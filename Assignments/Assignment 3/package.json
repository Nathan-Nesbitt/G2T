The outline of the course can be found in the main repo as [outline_G2T_NN.pdf](https://github.com/Nathan-Nesbitt/G2T/blob/master/Outline_G2T_NN.pdf). These are not meant to be used as slides or information for students. I normally prepare/live-code and share the detailed code/notes with the students in the class, which are the actual notes for the session.",
