## What is this?
These are my instructional/personal notes for the web development course I teach.
This is not intended as a walk through but rather an overview of the topics that I cover. The outline of the course can be found in the main repo as [outline_G2T_NN.pdf](https://github.com/Nathan-Nesbitt/G2T/blob/master/Outline_G2T_NN.pdf). These are not meant to be used as slides or information for students. I normally prepare/live-code and share the detailed code/notes with the students in the class, which are the actual notes for the session.  This is because the course has evolved over time, and not all of the information
in this repository is included in the class.
